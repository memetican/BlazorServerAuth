# Webflow Preview Link

{% embed url="https://wfu.sygnal.com/docs/webflow-demo/preview-link/" %}

Enables you to dynamically construct a Webflow preview link to the current page.

### What is a Preview Link? <a href="#what-is-a-preview-link" id="what-is-a-preview-link"></a>

In Webflow, a [preview link](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/share-your-project-and-invite-collaborators) is a special link that allows someone to view a read-only version of your Webflow site in the designer.

### What would you Use this for? <a href="#what-would-you-use-this-for" id="what-would-you-use-this-for"></a>

If you develop Webflow sites, and want to make it easy for someone to click a button that switches the current page into a design mode view, this utility enables that.

### How to Use it <a href="#how-to-use-it" id="how-to-use-it"></a>

* You must have created a preview link to your site, and extract the preview link Id. It looks something like this- `4d388483d99c6cc36c58ae966e92c615`.

Limitations;

* Does not work with Collection pages, since they require an additional collection item ID that is not emitted into the page.

### Implementation <a href="#implementation" id="implementation"></a>

* Add this script

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@4.11/src/nocode/webflow-demo.min.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

* Add any links in the page, that you want to point to the designer view.
* Set the href to the default designer link generated by Webflow.
* Add a custom attribute of `wfu-demo-link=preview`

Best practices;

* Put in the site-level configuration so that it appears on all pages. Then you can choose which pages actually utilize it.

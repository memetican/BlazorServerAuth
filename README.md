**Sygnal Webflow Utils v3.341 (WFU)** is a collection of javascript libraries that add functionality to [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) sites. It focuses on overcoming certain limitations of Webflow, and adding certain capabilities.

Some of the most popular features include;

* Data-binding form INPUT and SELECT elements to your collection lists
* Adding custom attributes dynamically to elements within a collection list.
* Adding tables support, with data sourced from Google Sheets
* Multilingual support through language-detection and a dynamic content-switcher

All of these features work with Webflowâ€™s native hosting, and are focused on creating as much capability within Webflow as possible - with no 3rd party plug-ins or monthly service fees.

This project is also a practical exploration into the use of Javascript ES6 modules, NPM, and other state-of-the art web dev technologies, and how they can be used to enhance Webflow sites.

_This library will be expanded as needed, and broken into modules for convenient selection of the parts you need._
